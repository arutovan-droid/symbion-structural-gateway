**First open-source framework for structural document understanding in AI**

> Turning any LLM into an architecturally-aware system

## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional AI sees documents as flat text streams, losing crucial structural meaning. This leads to hallucinations and poor context understanding.

## 💡 Our Solution

Symbion Structural Gateway adds **structural intelligence layer** to any LLM:

- **DeepSeek OCR** for semantic layout understanding  
- **Structural Prompt Engineering** for context enhancement
- **Universal API Gateway** for seamless integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from symbion_gateway import StructuralGateway

gateway = StructuralGateway()
enhanced_prompt = gateway.enhance_document(
    "research_paper.pdf", 
    ai_provider="chatgpt"
